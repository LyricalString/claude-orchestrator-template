## Context

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Instructions

1. **Read the existing PLAN file** to understand investigation findings
2. Review against codebase patterns in AGENTS.md (if exists):
   - Data-fetching patterns
   - Mutation patterns
   - Service layer patterns
   - Component patterns
3. Create a detailed implementation plan with:
   - Specific files to modify
   - Code changes needed
   - Order of operations (parallel vs sequential agents)
   - Testing checklist
4. **Update the PLAN file** with the complete implementation plan
5. Present the plan for my approval

Do NOT implement yet - only plan.
